OK, class, settle down. 
I have the results of your individual personality tests. 
I am going to hand them out, and if you'd like, you can read them out loud to the rest of the class. 

I'll read mine. 

OK, go ahead. 

It says here that I am adventurous, outgoing and easygoing. 
It says that I'm a little superstitious and occasionally naive. 
That's not true. 

Well, the test isn't 100% accurate. Is that all it says? 

No, it also says that I'm open minded with great ambition, but that I can also be reckless and clumsy. 
This is stupid. 

OK, anyone else want to read theirs? 

I'll go. It says that I'm an extroverted, well balanced person. 
It says I am generous, outspoken and very diligent. 
This is so true. 
It also says that I am a magnanimous, eloquent and daring. 
This is totally me. 

Whatever, these tests are baloney.
