Excuse me, waiter. 

Yes sir, what can I do for you? 

I've been sitting here for the past 20 minutes, 
and no one has offered me a glass of water, brought any bread to the table, 
and our appetizers haven't been served yet. 
You know, in this kind of establishment, I'd expect much better service.

I'm sorry sir, I'll check on your order right away. 

Relax, honey. The place is busy tonight, and I've heard the food is amazing anyway. 

Here you are, sir. The frog wall for the lady and a mushroom soup for you. 

Waiter, I ordered a cream of mushroom soup with asparagus, 
the soup is obviously too runny, and it's over seasoned. 
It's completely inedible. 

OK, I do apologize for that. 
Can I bring you another soup, or would you like to order something else? 

Take this foie Gras back as well, it's rubbery and completely overcooked. 
And look at that portion size. 
How can you charge $25 for a sliver of duck liver? 

Right away, sir. 

Honey, come on, the filet was fine. 
Why are you making such a big deal? 
Are you trying to get our meal comped again? 

What do you mean? 
We're paying for this, and I'm shelling out my hard-earned bucks. 
I expect value for money. 

Here you are, sir. 
I hope it is all right now. 
The chef has prepared it especially for you. 

Yes, fine. 

Honey, are you all right?
