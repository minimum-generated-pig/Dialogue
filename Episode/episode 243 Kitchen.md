I have been looking at this online catalog for over an hour, 
and I still haven't finished getting all the kitchen appliances that we need. 

What are you getting? 

Well, the first thing on my list is a new blender. 
I decided to also get a juicer and a new coffee maker.

Don't forget to also get a new mixer. 
I lent the old one to my brother, and he broke it. 

Yeah, I know. I also decided to throw away the old toaster, and get a new one. 
I am also getting a rice cooker, and a steamer to make some nice steamed fish or veggies. 

I'm actually thinking of completely refurnishing the kitchen, 
and getting a new stove, oven, dishwasher and trash compactor. 

That's a good idea. The kitchen will look amazing.
